# CIFAR-10 Image Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to work with the CIFAR-10 dataset, a widely-used dataset for image classification tasks. It includes steps for data visualization, preprocessing, model building, and training.

## **Features**

- **Dataset Loading**: Automatically loads the CIFAR-10 dataset using TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays sample images from the dataset.
- **Preprocessing**: Scales image pixel values to improve model performance.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Defines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Trains the model and evaluates its performance.

## **Usage**

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cifar10-image-classification.git
   ```

2. Run the cells in sequence to:
   - Load and visualize the CIFAR-10 dataset.
   - Preprocess the data.
   - Define and train the CNN model.
   - Evaluate and visualize the results.
